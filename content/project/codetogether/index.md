Code Together is an initiative co-hosted by myself and [Ivan Ruby](https://twitter.com/rubyivan){:target="_blank"} with the goal of supporting the coding community at Concordia University. Code Together offers drop-in sessions for people looking to set aside time for coding projects or troubleshoot bugs and issues with like-minded peers.
