If you‚Äôre like most people, you probably joined in without a second thought. Would you be surprised to know that the version of ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù you‚Äôre used to singing might be different every time?\nThe musical key that ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù is sung in often depends on the note that the person who starts the song chooses to sing first. This starting point determines the key for the rest of the song. We‚Äôre still able to recognize the song because the intervals ‚Äî the differences in pitch between notes ‚Äî remain the same and the notes just shift up or down depending on where that starting point is.\nThis act of shifting pitches up or down but preserving the intervals between notes is called transposition and although it may not seem like a simple task, people tend to handle it quite well. In one study, both children and adults easily recognized common songs like ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù and ‚ÄúTwinkle Twinkle Little Star‚Äù after they were presented at various keys.\nHow is it that most people can perform this complex musical task even in the absence of any formal musical training? Even though you may not realize it, you actually have a lot more musical knowledge than you might think.\nPattern Recognition Where does this knowledge of music come from? You get it from your everyday life without realizing it thanks to a process called statistical learning. This concept suggests that we learn about our environment through passive exposure and that we constantly use this knowledge to interpret the world around us. Statistical learning is how we learn to recognize patterns and can be used to explain complex learning processes like language acquisition. Significantly, this process is almost entirely subconscious ‚Äî we learn just by being exposed to new information.\nIn the case of music, we have no shortage of experience to draw from. We hear music constantly, whether intentionally or as a bystander. Riding in a car, standing in an elevator, sitting in a waiting room ‚Äî we can‚Äôt help but be exposed to music. And we gain something from this passive exposure: We become familiar with the patterns and regularities of the music of our culture and we develop an implicit knowledge of music.\nThis process happens very early on. Eight-month-old babies can recognize patterns in sequences of tones and some studies show that even at three months of age, babies can recognize changes in short melodies. This implicit musical knowledge only grows as we get older and is why most people might not be as musically challenged as they think.\nIn one study, people were recruited to sing in a public park and their performance was compared to that of professional singers. The results showed that the amateur singers‚Äô pitch and timing accuracy was close to that of experts. This aligns with other research showing that people without musical training also perform well on pitch discrimination tasks in which they have to recognize the difference between two tones that vary slightly in pitch.\nThese results might seem surprising at first, but they are backed by large-scale studies as well. While many people might claim to be tone deaf, some research estimates that the rate of congenital amusia ‚Äî a condition in which a person is unable to recognize or process musical information ‚Äî is less than two per cent in the general population.\nCultural Expectations Our implicit knowledge of music also leads us to develop expectations of how music should sound. That‚Äôs why music from other cultures might sound strange at first ‚Äî it deviates from the expectations you‚Äôve developed based on the music of your own culture.\nThis is also true across musical genres. Jazz musicians were found to be more accurate at predicting changes in jazz music than classical musicians and non-musicians.\nOur expectations are also responsible for generating musical pleasure and the desire to move when listening to music, and have been used as a tool by artists and composers for centuries to elicit stronger emotions.\nSo although you might not be aware of it, you‚Äôre a walking music processing machine. And next time you find yourself singing ‚ÄúHappy Birthday,‚Äù you can sing a bit more confidently with your hidden music expertise in mind.\nArticle originally published by The Conversation Canada\n","date":1646611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646611200,"objectID":"6b1728bee84606751a37b6528a4ae2a3","permalink":"/post/statistical-learning-theconversation/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/statistical-learning-theconversation/","section":"post","summary":"Think of the last time you were at a birthday party and the obligatory rendition of ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù began.

Creating a project will create a folder for you to keep all of your code files (scripts, .Rmd files, etc.), your data (Excel files, csv files, etc.), plots you want to save and anything else related to your project.\nYou can create projects by clicking the blue icon at the top right of RStudio, choosing ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù, and then ‚ÄúNew Directory‚Äù. You‚Äôll then have the chance to name your project and choose where on your computer to save it.\n\rPackages\rPackages are collections of external software usually designed around a specific theme (visualization, statistics, etc.). Packages can be installed directly from RStudio using the install.packages() function. We‚Äôll be using a package called tidyverse which is actually a collection of packages. Installing tidyverse would look like this:\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;)\rImportantly, you only need to install a package once (unless you want to update it). But to use a package you have to load it every time you start a new RStudio session. This is done with the library() function.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rWe‚Äôll only be using the readr and ggplot2 packages but it‚Äôs easier to install all of tidyverse.\n\rData Import\rOne common way to import data into R is as csv files. ‚Äòcsv‚Äô stands for comma separated values and is an efficient way of storing data as text separated by commas. If you‚Äôre working with an excel document you can easily save it as a .csv file. If you already have a lot of excel files that you don‚Äôt want to convert, there are packages that will read .xls files as is (see https://readxl.tidyverse.org/).\nThe read_csv() function from the readr package (included in tidyverse) is the easiest way to read in .csv files. (Note: read.csv() is the Base R equivalent and will work the same, more or less. But if you‚Äôre using tidyverse functions I‚Äôd recommend using read_csv())\nThe basic format of read_csv is to pass it either the file name of your data (saved in the same working directory that RStudio is using), or a url to data stored online, using quotes in both cases. And we assign the data to whatever name we want with \u0026lt;-\nHere‚Äôs how this might look on your computer with a file inside your project folder.\n#read csv file and save to name\rmydata \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;my_csv_file.csv\u0026quot;)\rRemember that read_csv() comes from the readr package which is a part of tidyverse. To use it you will have to load either readr or tidyverse using library().\n\rPalmer Penguins\rWe‚Äôll be using the Palmer Penguin data and we can import it directly from a url.\n# load data from online\rpenguins \u0026lt;- readr::read_csv(\u0026#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-28/penguins.csv\u0026#39;)\rArtwork by @allison_horst\nLet‚Äôs take a quick look at what the data looks like. We have 8 variables.\nhead(penguins)\r## # A tibble: 6 x 8\r## species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_~ body_mass_g sex ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;\r## 1 Adelie Torge~ 39.1 18.7 181 3750 male ## 2 Adelie Torge~ 39.5 17.4 186 3800 fema~\r## 3 Adelie Torge~ 40.3 18 195 3250 fema~\r## 4 Adelie Torge~ NA NA NA NA \u0026lt;NA\u0026gt; ## 5 Adelie Torge~ 36.7 19.3 193 3450 fema~\r## 6 Adelie Torge~ 39.3 20.6 190 3650 male ## # ... with 1 more variable: year \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r\rggplot\rggplot2 is the most popular package for plotting in R. It‚Äôs built by the same people who make tidyverse and RStudio so it plays well with other tidyverse packages. It‚Äôs almost infinitely customizeable and there are lots of external add-ons to make interesting and vibrant visualizations.\nHere is a template of what the code for a typical ggplot will look like:\n#ggplot template\rggplot(data = \u0026lt;DATA\u0026gt;) + \u0026lt;GEOM_FUNCTION\u0026gt;(mapping = aes(x, y))\rThink of ggplots as being constructed in layers. You start with a blank canvas and then add new layers on top of each other. (The ‚Äúgg‚Äù in ggplot stands for ‚Äúgrammar of graphics‚Äù which is short for the concept of a ‚Äúlayered grammar of graphics‚Äù.)\nEvery ggplot will start with with the ggplot() function. Every one. Every time. Let‚Äôs see what ggplot() gives us by itself.\nggplot()\rA blank square. This is our blank canvas that I talked about above. We have the space for a plot but haven‚Äôt told ggplot what to put on it yet. Let‚Äôs take a look at our template again.\n#ggplot template\rggplot(data = \u0026lt;DATA\u0026gt;) + \u0026lt;GEOM_FUNCTION\u0026gt;(mapping = aes(x, y))\rAfter ggplot() you add layers that are called ‚Äúgeoms‚Äù. There‚Äôs a geom for just about every type of plot you can think of (e.g.¬†geom_point, geom_smooth, geom_boxplot). Geoms tell ggplot what you want to do with the raw data.\nEvery new layer of a ggplot is separated by a plus sign + on the previous line. Be careful not to forget this.\nThe required arguments for a ggplot are data and mapping which tell ggplot which dataframe to use and which variables to use, respectively. When you specify a mapping you‚Äôll also use another function called aes(). The variables you use will always go inside the aes() function. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about the specifics of aes() right now. Just remember to always put the variables you‚Äôre plotting inside it e.g.¬†aes(x, y)\nScatterplots\rDo penguins with long flippers also have long bills? We can use geom_point() to make a scatterplot. We have two numeric variables that we want to assign to the x- and y-axes and the names of our variables are bill_length_mm and flipper_length_mm.\nggplot(data = penguins)+\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))\rNamed arguments are optional in R so you don‚Äôt have to specify things like data= and mapping= (just make sure your arguments are in the right place!).\n# this\rggplot(data = penguins)+\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))\r#same as this\rggplot(penguins)+\rgeom_point(aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm))\rNaming arguments is partially up to personal preference. As you become more familiar with functions you might choose to not include argument names to save typing and make code more concise. If you think it would be more clear for yourself or someone else reading your code, you can include some arguments. In some of the following examples I will include the x and y arguments for clarity.\nEven better, every geom can take it‚Äôs own data and arguments OR you can specify them in your first ggplot() line. Everything in the ggplot() function will be inherited by every line below it. (Tip: Don‚Äôt forget commas between arguments.)\n# this\rggplot(penguins)+\rgeom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))\r#same as this\rggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point()\rWhat this means is that we can easily add extra geoms that use the same data. What if we want to add a line to our scatter plot? geom_smooth() adds a line of best fit with standard error.\n# adding a line\rggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point()+\rgeom_smooth()\r## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rIf you want a linear relationship, you can specify method = \"lm\" (short for ‚Äúlinear model‚Äù) inside geom_smooth()\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point()+\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\r\rAdding extra variables\rThere are features of a ggplot that can be changed to reflect differences between groups such as colour and shape. These are arguments that can be set inside of the aes() function and provided with a categorical variable to group by.\nFor example, what if we wanted to colour points by species. We can set the colour argument to be equal to the ‚Äúspecies‚Äù variable in our data.\n# colour by species\rggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species))+\rgeom_point()+\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rNotice that we also got separate lines for each species. This is because we set colour inside the first ggplot() line, so the grouping is inherited by all the layers below it. If we wanted to only colour the points, we can move the colour argument to geom_point() (inside of it‚Äôs own aes() function).\n# colour by species\rggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point(aes(colour = species))+\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rWe can do the same thing with the shape argument.\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point(aes(colour = species, shape = species))+\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rDisplaying a third numeric variable\rIt can be harder to display three numeric variables in one plot, but one option is to vary point size by the third variable using the size argument.\nggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point(aes(size = body_mass_g))\rThis plot is a bit hard to read. It would be helpful if we could see where points are clustering. We can do this by changing how transparent the points are with the alpha argument. Alpha ranges from 0 to 1 with one being solid.\nIf you want to change an aspect of all of the points (i.e.¬†not based on another variable), you can set that argument outside of aes().\nggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point(aes(size = body_mass_g), alpha = 0.4)\r\r\r\rThemes \u0026amp; Styling\rLabels\rThere are a lot of ways to add labels to your plot but one of the easiest is the labs() function that is added on a new line of your ggplot code. Let‚Äôs use our scatterplot example from earlier.\nInside of labs() you can specify labels for your x- and y-axes as well as a title and a subtitle if you‚Äôd like. To label your legend, you can add an argument with the same name as the aspect you grouped by (e.g.¬†colour, shape, etc.).\rBecause we used both colour and shape, we‚Äôll have to do some duplication and change the label for both.\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point(aes(colour = species, shape = species))+\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)+\rlabs(title = \u0026quot;Bill \u0026amp; Flipper Lengths of the Palmer Penguin Species\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Bill Length\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Flipper Length\u0026quot;, colour = \u0026quot;Species\u0026quot;, shape = \u0026quot;Species\u0026quot;)\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\r\rThemes\rAll of the aspects of a ggplot are customizeable including, grid lines, backgrounds, spacing, and axis ticks. While these can all be changed individually, ggplot comes with some built-in themes to make your plots look cleaner. ggplot themes act as their own function (i.e.¬†on a new line after +) and have the format theme_*. It‚Äôs typical to add a theme function as the last line of your ggplot code. One popular theme is theme_bw()\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point(aes(colour = species, shape = species))+\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)+\rlabs(title = \u0026quot;Bill \u0026amp; Flipper Lengths of the Palmer Penguin Species\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Bill Length\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Flipper Length\u0026quot;, colour = \u0026quot;Species\u0026quot;, shape = \u0026quot;Species\u0026quot;)+\rtheme_bw()\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rA personal favorite of mine is theme_classic()\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point(aes(colour = species, shape = species))+\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)+\rlabs(title = \u0026quot;Bill \u0026amp; Flipper Lengths of the Palmer Penguin Species\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Bill Length\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Flipper Length\u0026quot;, colour = \u0026quot;Species\u0026quot;, shape = \u0026quot;Species\u0026quot;)+\rtheme_classic()\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rFor examples on how to change smaller aspects of a ggplot, see the documentation on the theme() function https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html\n\r\rCategorical Variables\rHow many observations are there for each penguin species?\ngeom_bar counts the number of observations in your specified variable. Because the counting is done behind the scenes, you only need to provide one variable (on either the x or y axis; depending on the direction you want your bars to go).\nIf you already have a dataset of the values you want to plot (e.g.¬†counts or means), geom_col() plots raw values.\nggplot(penguins, aes(species))+\rgeom_bar()\rAdding Variables\rAdding additional variables works similar to what we‚Äôve seen before; additional attributes can be specified inside the aes() function. Importantly, ‚Äúcolour‚Äù will only colour the borders of the bars in a bar plot, to colour inside the bars, you‚Äôll want to use ‚Äúfill‚Äù instead.\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill = island))+\rgeom_bar()\rBy default, groups are stacked in bar plots. If you‚Äôd like a separate bar for each group you set the position argument in geom_bar to ‚Äúdodge‚Äù.\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, fill = island))+\rgeom_bar(position = \u0026quot;dodge\u0026quot;)\r\r\rFaceting\rWe can also create separate plots within plots using ggplot functions like facet_wrap() and facet_grid(). Inside of facet_wrap() you only need to provide the name of the variable you want to facet by after a tilde ~.\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+\rgeom_point()+\rgeom_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;)+\rfacet_wrap(~species)+\rtheme_bw()\r## `geom_smooth()` using formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\r\rSummary Statistics\rThere are several geoms that will calculate summary statistics for you, like geom_boxplot()\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g))+\rgeom_boxplot()\rThere‚Äôs also a corresponding geom_violin() that gives you a better idea of the distribution of your data.\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g))+\rgeom_violin()\rstat_summary()\rIn all of the geoms we‚Äôve used so far, there are a lot of functions doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes. In most cases, geoms will cover everything you need. But sometimes we might want more control over how our plot is made. This is where the stat_* functions come in, primarily, stat_summary().\nLet‚Äôs say we wanted a bar plot of the mean body mass for penguins of each species. There‚Äôs no geom that calculates a mean and displays bars. geom_bar() only calculates counts by default. Luckily, stat_summary() calculates mean and standard error by default.\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g))+\rstat_summary()\r## No summary function supplied, defaulting to `mean_se()`\rOops, that‚Äôs not a bar plot. There‚Äôs one more thing we have to change to get our bar plot. stat_summary() has a geom argument that by default is set to ‚Äúpointrange‚Äù which is what we‚Äôre seeing above. The geom we want is ‚Äúbar‚Äù so we‚Äôll add an argument inside stat_summary(). We can also add error bars with another stat_summary() layer.\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g))+\rstat_summary(geom = \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot;)+\rstat_summary(geom = \u0026quot;errorbar\u0026quot;)\r## No summary function supplied, defaulting to `mean_se()`\r## No summary function supplied, defaulting to `mean_se()`\rThis plot isn‚Äôt that informative about our data. Let‚Äôs see if we can do a little better. We can add some transparent points to show how our data are distributed. And we‚Äôll add some transparency to our bars so we can see the points, and add a border around them by setting the size argument. Also, we‚Äôll add some colour using fill just for aesthetics.\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g))+\rstat_summary(fun = \u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;,\rgeom = \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot;,\ralpha = 0.5,\rcolor = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;,\rsize = 0.5,\rmapping = aes(fill=species))+\rgeom_point(alpha = 0.3)\rThis a bit better but still not as clear as it could be. We still can‚Äôt see the distribution of the individual data points that well. We can use a useful function called geom_jitter() to fix this. geom_jitter() adds a small amount of random noise to points so you can more easily see where points are clustering. We set how much it ‚Äújitters‚Äù the data using the height and width arguments. geom_jitter() is also useful for crowded scatter plots.\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g))+\rstat_summary(fun = \u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;,\rgeom = \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot;,\ralpha = 0.5,\rcolor = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;,\rsize = 0.5,\rmapping = aes(fill=species))+\rgeom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1, alpha = 0.3)\rThis is better but because our data have relative high means with little variation, we have all this extra space in the bars. One option would be to zoom in on you plot using something like coord_cartesian() which lets you set the limits of your axes. In this case, we‚Äôre changing the ylim argument.\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g))+\rstat_summary(fun = \u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;,\rgeom = \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot;,\ralpha = 0.5,\rcolor = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;,\rsize = 0.5,\rmapping = aes(fill=species))+\rgeom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1, alpha = 0.3)+\rcoord_cartesian(ylim = c(2500, 6400))+\rtheme_bw()+\rguides(fill = FALSE)+ #get rid of legend\rlabs(x = NULL, y = \u0026quot;Body Mass (g)\u0026quot;)\rThis definitely looks better but maybe we could do more to represent the distribution in this data. geom_violin() can help with this. We‚Äôll add in some mean lines with stat_summary() and geom ‚Äúcrossbar‚Äù.\nggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g))+\rgeom_violin(alpha = 0.1, mapping = aes(fill = species), show.legend = F)+\rgeom_jitter(width = 0.05, height = 0.05, alpha = 0.3)+\rstat_summary(fun = \u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;, geom = \u0026quot;crossbar\u0026quot;, width = 0.3)+ # mean lines\rtheme_bw()+\rlabs(x = NULL, y = \u0026quot;Body Mass (g)\u0026quot;)\rBonus\rOne of the benefits of ggplot is it‚Äôs infinite customizeability. There are a ton of add-ons that let you make more complex and more effective lots. Here‚Äôs a small-scale example using a function called geom_flat_violin() by Ben Marwick. I source the function directly from a link where the code is hosted online but it can also be found in the PupillometryR package.\nsource(\u0026quot;https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benmarwick/2a1bb0133ff568cbe28d/raw/fb53bd97121f7f9ce947837ef1a4c65a73bffb3f/geom_flat_violin.R\u0026quot;)\rggplot(penguins, aes(species, body_mass_g, fill=species))+\rgeom_boxplot(width = 0.2, outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.8)+\rgeom_flat_violin(position = position_nudge(x = 0.2, y = 0), alpha = 0.8)+\rgeom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.5, size = 1)+\rguides(fill = FALSE, color = FALSE)+ # get rid of legend\rtheme_classic()+\rlabs(x = NULL, y = \u0026quot;Body Mass (g)\\n\u0026quot;)\r\r\rPlotly\rPlotly is a software that works across many platforms and languages and is used to make interactive visualizations.

These challenges only increase for subjects where interaction and engagement are key elements in the learning process, including programming.\n Programming is, at its core, a skill-based subject. While we might be able to listen to and understand a data science tutorial, trying to replicate programming techniques after only watching them would be like trying to play the violin after attending a symphony. Considering the importance of active participation in programming education, a situation in which student engagement is decreased becomes especially detrimental.\nHere are a few best practices from my experience leading data science workshops, that I believe can make the learning process smoother.\nMinimize Tech Issues Tech issues can be discouraging even in the best of times and might lead to disengagement or drop-outs. It‚Äôs important to remove as many potential hurdles for students as possible. Although giving learners installation and prep instructions beforehand is good practice, you need to be prepared for the very real possibility that students are coming with zero preparation, particularly for one-time events like workshops.\nFor this reason, I try to make sure that every resource I use in my workshops is easily accessible online. Through services such as binder and Google Colab, even the software used in workshops, including R and Python, can be accessed online, thereby eliminating the risk of installation issues.\nIf possible, even the data used in workshops should be accessible online without the need to download it. This avoids problems related to folders, file paths, and working directories; concepts that might be less intuitive than you think.\nBy removing these initial barriers, you can spend more time on content instead of debugging installation and download issues which are often hyper-specific.\nEngage Participants One way to improve interaction online is to make learners more invested in the content. Giving students control over their learning experience is a great way to promote autonomy and make them more active participants. One of the techniques I like to employ in data science is to give students choices over which data we use in a lesson. This interactivity helps to tailor content to student interests and leads to increased engagement and participation, when combined with Zoom tools such as polls and reactions.\nSee Things from a Learner\u0026rsquo;s Perspective Remember that learners don‚Äôt share your technology setup. So although you might have created the perfect work-from-home command centre, you should consider that many of your students will be viewing your content on a 13-inch laptop screen. This is an important consideration when deciding how to organize windows, which font size to use, and how to format slides. You might even want to go as far as joining your workshop on another computer so you can see what students see. Not only does this aid learning by making your material easier to follow, but it can also address important accessibility needs.\nOnline learning also gives us the opportunity to literally share the learner‚Äôs perspective. Anyone who has led a small, in-person workshop in tech or data science has likely had the experience of bouncing back and forth across the room, inspecting code and troubleshooting errors. Conversely, anyone who has tried troubleshooting remotely knows how frustrating it can be. One of the few benefits of online learning is the increased prevalence of screen-sharing. Screen-sharing allows not just the instructor but all of the other participants to be a part of the debugging process (provided that they are comfortable sharing their screen). This collaborative debugging can be a learning activity in itself.\nLooking Towards the Future Taken together, what stands out is that most of these techniques don‚Äôt need to be reserved for online learning. Although remote teaching might have pushed us to optimize our teaching techniques, there‚Äôs no reason we can‚Äôt take what we‚Äôve learned back to in-person classes. And as we make this transition, we‚Äôll have the opportunity to use blended learning approaches, allowing us to draw from the best of both worlds.\nArticle originally published on the GradProSkills Blog\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"0d1c1fe60cc90e3e55cb9d8b47624e66","permalink":"/post/teaching-data-science-gps/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/teaching-data-science-gps/","section":"post","summary":"Teaching data science online has revealed some useful strategies to be continued as we transition back to in-person teaching.","tags":["Data Science","Teaching"],"title":"Teaching Data Science Online - A Blessing or a Curse?","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Code Together is an initiative started by GradProSkills and co-hosted by myself and Ivan Ruby with the goal of supporting the coding community at Concordia University.
